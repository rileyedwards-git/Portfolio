									<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
					
									<p>I aspire to build a career in game design, combining creativity, technical skills,
									and problem-solving to create engaging experiences. 
									I'm particularly drawn to working at game development studios or design companies like SPARCK, 
									where innovation and user-focused design are key.
									In the future, I hope to be part of something that creates meaningful and visually impressive games that leave a lasting impact
									as all I want to do is ensure people like me have as much fun as I have</p>

									<p>Through my course in Computer Science Games Technology at Nottingham Trent University,
									I’ve developed a foundation in programming and design. 
									I’ve thoroughly enjoyed building and completing a project involving C++ game development using SFML
									where I implemented features like procedural maze generation, interactive UI, and game mechanics.
									Then designing my own textures to make my game more engaging and personalised.
									This experience have helped solidify my interest in games development </p>

									<p>Guest lectures have given me valuable insights into the importance of collaboration and
									staying updated with industry trends as well as the importance of being willing to always learn. 
									I’ve also learned that understanding user needs and being able to explain your design choices clearly are essential in professional environments. 
									I aim to further develop my technical and communication skills through placements and personal projects, 
									working towards a role where I can contribute in the games industry.</p>
