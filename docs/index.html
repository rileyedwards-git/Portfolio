											<h1>Portfolio&nbsp;</h1>
											<p>About me&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <!-- change this -->
										</header>
										<p>I am currently a first year Computer Science Games Technology student at Nottingham Trent University with a strong interest in design and technology. My academic background includes A-levels in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics, which gave me vital problem-solving skills that go well with my creative aspirations.
										My course has provided me with a solid foundation in programming, insight into design careers, and experience in collaborative group work. I am particularly passionate about game design, which I have explored through my own projects. Although my current game project is still a work in progress, it has taught me valuable skills in planning, prototyping, finalizing ideas, and implementing them.
										While my experience with software like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender is at a novice level, my enthusiasm for learning and exploring these reflects my dedication to going into a career in game design and, more broadly, the design industry.
										I am highly motivated to grow as a creative professional and contribute to projects that innovate, inspire, and push the boundaries of design and technology.
