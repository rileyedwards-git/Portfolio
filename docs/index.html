								<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
								<p>Computer Science (Games Tech) student passionate about game design and development</p>
							</header>
							<p>I'm Riley Edwards, a Computer Science Games Technology student at Nottingham Trent University. My academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics has strengthened my logical thinking, which I now apply to my interests in design and technology.</p>

							<p>These projects have allowed me to explore areas such as GUI systems, procedural generation, and gameplay mechanics, while developing skills in problem-solving, debugging, and iterative design.</p>

							<p>I'm currently learning more about tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, 3ds Max, and Blender. While my experience is still growing, I'm excited by the creative and technical challenges of game development and design more broadly.</p>

							<p>This portfolio showcases my journey so far - highlighting technical skills, career reflections, and professional growth. I'm eager to keep learning and contribute to innovative design and development projects in the future.</p>
