									<h2>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h2>
									<p>Throughout this module, I have developed both technical and professional skills.
									As part of this process, I’ve reflected on my professionalism,
									including how I work individually and with others.
									This has helped me identify areas of growth in communication, responsibility,
									and ethical awareness which are skills vital in any computing job.</p>
									
									<h2>Professional Values and Ethics</h2>
									<p>One key area of professional conduct I have considered is ethical responsibility, 
									particularly in line with the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">BCS Code of Conduct</a>. 
									The Code outlines professional obligations such as
									maintaining professional competence and behaving with integrity.</p>
									
									<p>For example during the development of my maze game project 
									I ensured that all assets and code used were either my own or properly declared as not of my own. 
									This aligns with the BCS principle of "respecting the intellectual property and contributions of others". 
									Additionally, I made efforts to manage my time and meet deadlines, 
									reflecting the value of diligence.</p>
									
									<h2>Teamwork and Communication</h2>
									<p>While most of my work was independent, I regularly engaged in peer feedback and discussions with friends. 
									This improved my confidence in expressing ideas and listening to others which is a reflection of 
									professional competence and respect as said in the BCS Code. 
									Learning to receive constructive criticism has helped prepare me for future professional 
									environments where collaboration is key.</p> 
									
									<h2>Areas for Growth</h2>
									<p>Although I’ve made progress, I can further improve my presentation and documentation skills. 
									As I pursue a career in game design, I will continue to develop my ability to communicate ideas 
									clearly and maintain professionalism in situations where it is needed.</p>
									
									<p>By aligning my conduct with the BCS values, 
									I aim to become not only a successful developer but also a responsible and ethical professional.</p>
