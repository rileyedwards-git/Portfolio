							<!-- Maze Runner Project -->
							<header>
								<h1>Game Project: Maze Runner</h1>
							</header>
							<p>This was my programming module project where I built a maze game in C++ using SFML - a library I hadn't touched before. I put together a login system, a simple GUI, a random maze generator, scoring, a timer, and a game-over state. It was my first time pulling lots of different systems into one working game.</p>

							</div>

							<h2>Problem Solving & Learning SFML</h2>
							<p>SFML wasn't part of the course, so I had to figure it out myself through tutorials and forums. The event loop and rendering were a bit of a headache at first, but I got the hang of it after a lot of trial and error.</p>

							<h2>Debugging & Testing</h2>
							<p>I tested things constantly - timers, scores, and odd cases like spamming menu clicks. Doing this made me a lot quicker at spotting and fixing problems.</p>

							<h2>Planning & Time Management</h2>
							<p>I broke the work into small steps: first the login system, then scoring, then timers, and so on. Keeping it bit by bit like this stopped me from losing focus and helped me actually finish the game.</p>

							<!-- Narrative Game Project -->
							<header>
								<h1>Game Project: 2D Narrative Game</h1>
							</header>
							<p>This was where I started getting into Unreal Engine with scripts. At the start I barely understood how C++ worked in Unreal, but over time I,ve managed to get a much better grip on it.</p>

							<h2>Using C++ and Blueprints</h2>
							<p>I learnt how Unreal handles gameplay logic through C++, which felt very different from the C++ I'd used before. I also used Blueprints for UI and simple stuff like menus and buttons. Using both together showed me just how flexible Unreal can be.</p>

							<h2>Custom Visuals</h2>
							<p>I made a few basic sprites and textures and dropped them into Unreal. They weren't amazing, but it was enough to get my own visuals in-game and make the project feel more like mine.</p>

							<h2>Small but Important Features</h2>
							<p>I added things like clicking on doors to move between levels and basic saving through the pause menu. They sound small, but these bits made the game feel more complete and taught me how to build little interactive systems.</p>

							<!-- 3D Game Project -->
							<header>
								<h1>Game Project: 3D Game</h1>
							</header>
							<p>This was the first time I tried Unreal Engine and Blender together, learning 3D from scratch. At first it was overwhelming, but I got used to the basics: setting up projects, using the editor, and understanding how levels and assets link together. I'm still nowhere near an expert, but I built a decent foundation for small 3D games and experiments. Sadly, most of the project files were lost as it's an old project, and I never finished it because of other responsibilities.</p>

							</div>

							<h2>Using Blueprints</h2>
							<p>I picked up Blueprints mainly by copying tutorials. I made a full inventory system and drag-and-drop items just using them. That showed me what Blueprints are best for. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I do find them quite natural to use now.</p>

							<h2>3D Modelling</h2>
							<p>I built my own 3D assets for this project. They started off really simple, but I enjoyed making them. I could tell I was improving when I began redoing earlier models to make them better.</p>
