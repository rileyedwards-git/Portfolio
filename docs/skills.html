							<!-- Maze Runner Project -->
							<header>
								<h1>Game Project: Maze Runner</h1>
							</header>
							<p>This was my programming module project where I built a maze game using C++ and SFML — a library I had no prior experience with. I developed a login system, a working GUI, a random maze generator, scoring, a timer, and a game-over state. It was my first time putting so many systems together into one playable project.</p>

							</div>

							<h2>Problem Solving & Learning SFML</h2>
							<p>Since SFML wasn’t taught in class, I had to teach myself through tutorials and forums. The event loop and rendering system were confusing at first, but I slowly figured them out through trial and error.</p>

							<h2>Debugging & Testing</h2>
							<p>I regularly tested features such as timers, scores, and edge cases like rapid menu clicks. This made me more confident at spotting and fixing bugs quickly.</p>

							<h2>Planning & Time Management</h2>
							<p>I kept myself on track by breaking the project into small steps — first the login system, then scoring, then timers, and so on. That helped me steadily build towards a finished game without losing focus.</p>

							<header>
								<h1>Game Project: 2D Narrative Game</h1>
							</header>
							<p>This project is where I started learning Unreal Engine from scratch. At first it felt overwhelming, but I managed to get comfortable with the basics: setting up projects, using the editor, and understanding how levels and assets fit together. I’m still far from an expert, but I’ve built a decent foundation for making small games and experimenting with ideas.</p>

							</div>

							<h2>Using C++ and Blueprints</h2>
							<p>I learnt how Unreal handles gameplay logic through C++, which was very different from the C++ I’d used before. Alongside that, I used Blueprints for UI and simple behaviours like menus and buttons. Mixing both approaches helped me see how flexible Unreal can be.</p>

							<h2>Custom Visuals</h2>
							<p>I made some basic sprites and textures and brought them into Unreal. They weren’t professional quality, but it showed me how to get my own visuals into the engine and use them in-game, which made the project feel more personal.</p>

							<h2>Small but Important Features</h2>
							<p>I added interaction systems like clicking on doors to move between levels, and simple saving options inside the pause menu. These may sound small, but they taught me how to design interactive elements that make a game feel more complete.</p>
