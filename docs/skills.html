						<h2>Problem Solving in Game Development</h2>
						<p>
							During my programming module, I created a maze game using C++ and SFML — a library I had no prior experience with. 
							Challenges included developing a working GUI system and implementing a random maze generator. I also added a login system, scoring, a game-over state, and a timer.
							These demonstrate my ability to quickly learn new tools and combine systems effectively — an essential skill in game and software development.
						</p>

						<h2>Self-Teaching SFML</h2>
						<p>
							SFML wasn't taught during lectures, so I independently followed tutorials and forums to learn how to use it.
							Understanding the event loop structure was tricky at first, but I gradually adapted to it and overcame rendering issues through further research.
						</p>

						<h2>Debugging and Testing</h2>
						<p>
							I regularly tested my game to make sure all features worked. This included verifying the login system, making sure timers and scores updated correctly,
							and testing edge cases like timeouts or rapid menu clicks. Through this, I developed a better understanding of how my code interacted and became quicker at spotting bugs.
						</p>

						<h2>Planning and Time Management</h2>
						<p>
							I listed all the features I wanted and broke them into small tasks, such as completing the login system first
