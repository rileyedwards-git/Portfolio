									<h2>Continuous Professional Development (CPD)</h2>
									<p>I have actively worked to improve my technical and professional skills.
									This includes completing practical programming tasks related to C++, and SFML. 
									I have also focused on improving skills like teamwork, problem-solving, time management, 
									and communication to help prepare for my future career in the industry.</p>
									<p>I've maintained a CPD record to track progress.
									This section outlines some highlights and plans for further development.</p>

										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Learned SFML basics and set up project in Visual Studio</td>
											<td>Feb 5</td>
											<td>Independent Learning</td>
											<td>This helped build my foundation in graphics programming and familiarised me with using SFML in Visual Studio.</td>
											<td>I followed tutorials to set up and run a basic SFML window and draw simple shapes.</td>
											<td>I felt more confident using external libraries and managing C++ projects independently.</td>
											<td>Explore more advanced SFML features like sound</td>
											<td>2</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Collaborated with peers on group course work</td>
											<td>Feb 15</td>
											<td>Group Project</td>
											<td>This developed my communication and teamwork skills which essential for working in game development.</td>
											<td>We divided tasks, shared progress, and discussed solutions to challenges.</td>
											<td>I appreciated the value of collaborating.</td>
											<td>Participate in more group work.</td>
											<td>36</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Implemented GUI buttons with hover/click feedback</td>
											<td>Mar 14</td>
											<td>Technical Skill Development</td>
											<td>This was key to improving user interface design and interaction techniques.</td>
											<td>I created buttons using SFML shapes and handled mouse events to trigger visual and functional feedback.</td>
											<td>It made my game feel more interactive, polished and improved user experience.</td>
											<td>Enhance GUI with animations and accessibility features.</td>
											<td>12</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Worked on time management and task prioritization to meet assignment deadlines</td>
											<td>Mar 20</td>
											<td>Personal Development</td>
											<td>Improving these skills helps me handle academic and future job responsibilities effectively.</td>
											<td>I broke tasks into smaller goals, tracked progress, and adjusted plans to stay on track.</td>
											<td>I learned to balance workload and stay productive under pressure.</td>
											<td>Continue using time tracking tools and reflect on productivity weekly.</td>
											<td>5</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Added a score system and random maze generation to the game</td>
											<td>Apr 10</td>
											<td>Project Development</td>
											<td>These features demonstrate practical application of algorithms and game logic.</td>
											<td>I implemented a dynamic scoring mechanism and a maze generator using algorithms.</td>
											<td>It felt rewarding to make the game more engaging and complex.</td>
											<td>Improve generation to avoid rare bugs.</td>
											<td>12</td>

									<h2>Future Development Goals</h2>
									<p>After this module, I aim to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Continue learning C++ and explore more advanced SFML features</li>
										<li>Study Unreal Engine C++ to complement my work with Blueprints</li>
										<li>Build a portfolio of mini-games demonstrating different mechanics</li>
										<li>Research placements</li>
										<li>Stay updated with industry trends</li>
									</ul>
